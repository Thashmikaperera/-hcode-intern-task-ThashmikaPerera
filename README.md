**Repository for Hcode intern task(Fitness Tracker Application)**
Project Description:This project is a web-based fitness tracker that allows users to log workouts, set fitness goals, and track their progress over time. Built with a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend, the app enables secure user registration, workout logging (exercise type, duration, calories burned), and goal updates. Users can view progress data and workout history, with optional visualizations. The interface is styled using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness across devices, and the backend uses MySQL for data storage.
